        <h2>Refund policy</h2>
        <!-- ========== -->
        <h4>Refund Policy</h4>

        <p>Orders delivered & accepted by the customer cannot be refunded.</p>
        <p>In case you feel the order is not as per specification, please contact our customer care team immediately in
            24hrs.
        </p>
        <!-- ============= -->
        <h4>Cancellation Policy</h4>

        <p>Nursery believes in helping its customers as far as possible and has, therefore, a liberal cancellation
            policy. Under this policy:
        </p>

        <p>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within 24 hours of placing an order. However,
            the
            cancellation request will not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants
            and
            they have initiated the process of shipping them.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is no cancellation of orders placed under the Same Day Delivery category.
        </p>

        <p>No cancellations are entertained for those products that the Nursery marketing team has obtained on special
            occasions like Pongal, Diwali, Valentineâ€™s Day etc. These are limited occasion offers and therefore
            cancellations are not possible.
        </p>

        <p>In case of receipt of damaged or defective consumer durable items and nondurable items, please report the
            same to
            our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be entertained once the merchant has checked and
            determined the same at his own end. This should be reported within 1 day of receipt of the products.
        </p>

        <p>
            In case you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must
            bring it to the notice of our customer service within 24 hours of receiving the product. The Customer
            Service
            Team after looking into your complaint will take an appropriate decision.
