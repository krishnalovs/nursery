        <h2>Shipping policy</h2>
        <!-- ======= -->

            only.

            and delivering of the shipment subject to Courier Company/post office norms.

            guarantees to hand over the consignment to the courier company or postal authorities within 7 working days
            from the date of the order and payment or as per the delivery date agreed at the time of order confirmation.
        </p>

        <h4>Payments</h4>

        <p>Nursery live is proud to use EBS, Payu, PayTM and other online payment systems for fast, easy and efficient
            secure payments. All major credit cards are accepted.

        <h4>Shipping & Delivery Policy (Services)</h4>

        <p>Delivery of our services will be confirmed on your mail ID as specified during registration. For any issues
            in utilizing our services, you may contact our helpdesk.
        </p>

        <p>How the delivery charge is calculated for multiple units and some products </p>

        <p>For Indian customers, the shipping charge is Rs 79 for all orders.</p>

        <p>We do not ship products out of India. For multiple products ordered the program adds up the weight of all the
            units ordered and charges a single delivery fee.
        </p>

        <p>However, the delivery fee is calculated separately when a customer orders different plants to be delivered
            at different locations. This is because the products are being sourced and shipped from different cities.
        </p>
        <!-- ======== -->
        <h4>Disclaimer</h4>

        <p>The product will be delivered for all urban areas in India serviceable by major courier agencies. For
            remote/rural areas the product will be sent by local couriers / Indian Speed Post and may take more time.
        </p>

        <p>* No Deliveries on Sunday and National Holidays.</p>
