        <h1>Top 10 Plants Proven to Attract Butterflies</h1>
        <p>“Butterflies are flying flowers, and flowers are tethered butterflies” - Ponce Denis Écouchard Le Brun.</p>
        <h3>Why Grow A Butterfly Garden?</h3>
        <h4><b>Reverse The Damage</b></h4>
        <p>For time immeasurable, humans have been the arch-nemesis to the survival of butterflies. We’ve destroyed
            their habitats at an ever-growing pace and this has led to the decline, and even destruction of certain
            species of butterflies.
        </p>
        <p>Our rampant use of insecticides and pesticides has been lethal to the butterfly population all over the
            world.For being poor practitioners of coexistence, we really do owe some support back to the butterflies.
        </p>
        <h4><b>It’s Easy-To-Do</b></h4>
        <p>Butterfly gardens are not rocket-science. If you do love gardening, it can be a cake walk. We’ll go over the
            basics later in the blog and you’ll see how it doesn’t take much.
        </p>

        <h3><b>Three Basic Steps To Make Your Garden Butterfly-Friendly</b></h3>
        <h4><b>1.Food </b></h4>
        <p>The needs of butterflies are not very different from our own-food, water, and shelter.The plants in your
            garden will serve as food for the butterflies. To maintain a sustainable butterfly garden, you need two
            types of plants - Host Plants and Nectar Plants.
        </p>
        <p>Host Plants are where the butterfly lays eggs. These also serve as food for the developing caterpillar once
            the larvae hatches. Nectar Plants are food for the grown butterflies themselves.
        </p>
        <h4><b>2.Water</b></h4>
        <p>Like any living being, butterflies too need water. While they prefer muddy-mushy spots to drink from, a
            shallow bowl can work fine too. You can also consider soaking sponges in water and keeping them around the
            bowl to act as landing spaces for their delicate bodies.
        </p>
        <h4><b>3. Shelter</b></h4>
        <p>Make sure your garden is open and receives enough sunlight; butterflies love open sunny spaces. If you live
            in a windy place, try to find a solution to shelter them from the wind as much as possible.
